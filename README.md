Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building APIs that can be used by any application, including third-party apps. In this project, I'm using serializers to convert complex data types into Python native data, and then from Python into JSON format. This allows third-party applications to easily access and interact with the data through the API. It's a highly versatile and interesting approach to developing modern web applications.
